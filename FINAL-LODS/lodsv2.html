        The history of computer network architecture is filled with fascinating
        milestones and trivia. The journey began with ARPANET, where the first
        message sent on October 29, 1969, was "LO" before the system crashed.
        This early network utilized packet switching, a concept independently
        developed by Paul Baran and Donald Davies in the early 1960s. Ethernet,
        another cornerstone of networking, was conceived by Robert Metcalfe in
        1973 at Xerox PARC, famously sketched on a napkin. TCP/IP became the
        standard protocol for ARPANET on January 1, 1983, a date known as "Flag
        Day". The World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee, had its first
        website go live on August 6, 1991, hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN.
        Wi-Fi, a term coined as a play on "Hi-Fi", revolutionized wireless
        networking, though it does not stand for "Wireless Fidelity" as commonly
        thought. The first domain name, "symbolics.com", was registered on March
        15, 1985. Internet usage exploded from 16 million users in 1995 to 361
        million by 2000. The IBM Simon Personal Communicator, released in 1994,
        is considered the first smartphone, offering email and basic web
        browsing. Lastly, IPv6 was developed to address the limitations of IPv4,
        providing an almost unimaginably large address space capable of
        generating 340 undecillion unique IP addresses. These milestones
        highlight the rapid evolution and key innovations that have shaped
        modern computer network architecture.
