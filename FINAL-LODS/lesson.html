            computer can, if they have permission, get information from any

          <h1>Simplex</h1>
          <p>
            In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a
            one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit;
            the other can only receive. For example, Keyboards.

          <p>
            With half-duplex, communications happen in both directions, but in
            only one direction at a time. When two computers communicate using
            half-duplex, one computer sends a signal and the other receives;
            then, at some point, they switch sending and receiving roles. For
            example, push-to-talk technology (walkie-talkie).

            Full-duplex communications are similar to a telephone call, in which
            both people can talk simultaneously.

        - As discuss previous, the purpose of networking is to share resources,
        but we don't know how this is accomplished? -This depends on the
        architecture of the network operating system software. The two most
        common network types are peer-to-peer and client/server.

            In peer-to-peer networks, the connected computers have no
            centralized authority. From an authority viewpoint, all of these
            computers are equal. Each computer in a peer-to-peer network can be
            both a client that requests resources and a server that provides
            resources. There is no assigned role for any particular device, and
            each of the devices usually runs similar software.

        - A topology is basically a map of a network. The physical topology of a
        network describes the layout of the cables and workstations and the
        location of all network components. Topologies can be either physical or
        logical.

          <p>
            In mesh topology each device is connected to every other device on
            the network through a dedicated point-to-point link. When we say
            dedicated it means that the link only carries data for the two
            connected devices only. Lets say we have n devices in the network
            then each device must be connected with (n-1) devices of the
            network. Number of links in a mesh topology of n devices would be
            n(n-1)/2.

            doesn’t allow direct communication between devices, a device must
